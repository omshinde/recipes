PLEASE READ THE WHOLE RECIPE.

Let's make tea for 2 individuals-

1. Pour 1 cup of water in a container and put it over ignition.
2. Add 6 full table spoons of sugar to it.(This is the amount of sugssar which I like, you need to learn what amount you like).
3. Add 3 full table spoons of tea to it.(This is the amount of tea which I like, you need to learn what amount you like).
5. Stretch your body a bit till the tea and sugar dissolves in water. You might be enjoying the aroma of tea.
6. Optional: You can add flavors like cardamom, garlic et cetera to make your tea more attractive.
7. Close the ignition after some time(around 5 minutes) when the amalgamation looks like containing less water. 
 
 OH LORD ! Wait you didn't added MILK. So, before stretching "4. ADD 1.5 cups of MILK to the container" and continue with further steps.
